  "body": "Business demands and processes are continuing to evolve. User/consumer demands, in terms of how they desire to interact with these business processes are also changing. The challenge then, is how to give these new users access to the vast amount of information available in existing systems, in new ways. Every time a functional unit within an enterprise adopts a new technology, takes advantage of a business opportunity or, serves their clientele in new ways, new \"authority\" is needed to access secure Corporate information assets. Every time this occurs an enormous amount of time, money and human resource is expended on yet another technology for the IT department to deal with and integrate into the existing application portfolio and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe result is generally time consuming and costly, both to the enterprise in terms of IT expenditures and to the users who are attempting to utilize this new functionality. The answer to this perplexing problem lies in establishing an open architecture that is not \"hardwired\" to any particular product or language and can be extended to support new technologies that offer competitive advantage. It has to be both cost effective and non-invasive to the functionality of those applications, thus preserving the business logic and data integrity achieved through years of usage and refinement. And yes, it should have the capacity to address the presentation components of tomorrow’s applications!\r\n\r\nPassport2 is a software agent that allows the separation of data, logic, communications, host to host and host to user components in existing applications with zero invasiveness. Passport2 satisfies the demands of today’s electronic business by integrating the functionality of newer technologies without compromising the integrity of legacy applications..\r\nThe ability to modify isolated components provides maximum flexibility allowing the blending of existing systems in meaningful ways with some of the new packages or technologies currently available. In addition this can become common ground where the programming efforts in COBOL and new languages (JAVA, Visual Basic, HTML, etc.) can easily be combined to best serve the business needs of the enterprise.\r\n\r\n###The Benefits:\r\n\r\nLow risk/low cost\r\nZero invasiveness\r\nProvides programmer collaboration\r\nLinks disparate sources of information\r\nNew technology integration/legacy code preservation\r\nUnlimited flexibility in data mixing\r\nSavings on reengineering for e-business\r\nIncreased user productivity and efficiency\r\nReduction in training expenses/accelerated learning curves\r\n\r\nPassport2 is a non-invasive solution that provides low risk and low cost to the user/market demands for cross system, interface dialogue and information sharing from legacy applications. With a minimal client side footprint requirement; zero for ASP/HTML deployment and a very low 400 kilobytes file for Windows or NT workstations or servers, Passport2 is an ideal, compact solution to the user/customer demands for \"fresher looking\" screens for legacy applications.\r\n\r\n",
